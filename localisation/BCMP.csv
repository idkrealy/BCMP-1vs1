end_moldavia_independence_title;End Moldavian Self Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
end_moldavia_independence_desc;Ever since the 1829 Treaty of Adrianople, Wallachia and Moldavia were placed under Russian military rule, without overturning Ottoman suzerainty. Under the Treaty of Adrianople, the Sultan guaranteed the previously promised autonomy to Serbia, promised autonomy for Greece, and allowed Russia to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia until the Ottoman Empire had paid a large indemnity. By establishing our dominance over these provinces, we can expel the Russian rulers and annex them back to the Ottoman Empire, centralizing rule and restoring order to these territories that belong in our empire. They can, however, resist, which would lead to war with them and potentially any Great Powers that support them. This decision will also sour our relations with other Great Powers, especially Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

russification_of_finland_title;The Integration of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
russification_of_finland_desc;Having enjoyed prosperity and control over their own affairs, and having remained loyal subjects, the manifesto which the $MONARCHTITLE$ issued on $YEAR$ was cause for Finnish despair. The manifesto was forced through the Finnish senate by the deciding vote of the senate president, an appointee of the $MONARCHTITLE$ â€” and after the governor-general of Finland had threatened a military invasion and siege. While ostensibly affirming the Finns' rights in purely local matters, the manifesto asserted the authority of the state in any and all matters which could be considered to "come within the scope of the general legislation of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ empire". The main policies enacted were:\nThe conscription law, incorporating the Finnish army into the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army.\nThe Language Manifesto of $YEAR$ which made $COUNTRY_ADJ$ the language of administration of Finland.\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Church was the church of state, including, for example, criminalizing the act of subjecting a follower of said chuch to another church service.\nThe Manifesto of $YEAR$ which asserted the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government's right to rule Finland without the consent of local legislative bodies, including control of the press if necssary and restrictions of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ currency and stamps as the only ones allowed.\nOur Finnish subjects will surely not like this and they might try to resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
